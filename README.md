## **Backbox Control Protocol (BCP) Server for Unity** ##

This [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) add-on was developed to provide the communication layer between a pinball controller and a Unity backbox application using the Backbox Communication Protocol (BCP).  BCP is a simple, fast protocol for communications between an implementation of a pinball game controller and a multimedia controller.  The [BCP Specification](https://missionpinball.com/docs/programming-guide/bcp1-0-spec/) was developed as part of the [Mission Pinball Framework](https://missionpinball.com).  This guide is designed to get you started building your own multimedia controller for your backbox using Unity.  This document does not attempt to cover the fundamentals of developing applications in Unity.  If you are new to Unity, there are numerous tutorials and a very active development community to help get you started.  It should also be noted that this add-on only provides the communication layer for your project and does not contain any additional logic or functionality building blocks for a pinball backbox.

For more information, see the [Backbox Control Protocol (BCP) Server for Unity Developer's Guide](Assets/BCP/Backbox%20Communication%20Protocol%20%28BCP%29%20Server%20for%20Unity%20-%20Deveoper%27s%20Guide.pdf) (writing still in progress).
